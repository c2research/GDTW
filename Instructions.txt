Time Series Classification:
Code used for this experiment in in folder "1NN Code"
1. Run the file main_mink.m for Minkowski distance, it will save the dataset name and error rate to a text file 'Mink_distance.txt'. main_mink.m contains the names of all datasets to run.
2. Run main_manhatan.m for mahattan distance.It will save the dataset name and error rate to a text file 'Manhatan_distance.txt'
3. Run main_ucr_euclidean.m for Euclidean distance.It will save the dataset name and error rate to a text file 'Euclidean_distance.txt'

Rest of the experiments (Best Match Retreival, Cardinality of Warping, Sensitivity to Local Distortion) from section 5.2.2-5.2.4 use the code in GDTW_Experiments

1. Open project GDTWCode.pro
2. Run the project
3. Enter filename with full path and press Enter, e.g. if ItalyPower.txt in path C:\ItalyPowerN.txt (after copying this path press enter)
4. Type N (I.e number of time series for example 67 for ItalyPower), press Enter key
5. Type L, (Length of time series, for example 24 for ItalyPower)press Enter key
6. Type the path of file where cost matrix for GDTW is to be written. The file will be created in the path specified. e.g C:\matrix.txt

To find GDTW BETWEEN PAIR OF SEQUENCES
7.	Press 1 to find GDTW between 2 sequences, press Enter key
8.	Enter first sequence id (i.e if first sequence Is TS0[1,23], type 0, press Enter key
9.	Type start of first sequence (1 for TS0[1,23]), Press Enter key.
10.	Type end of first sequence (23 for TS0[1,23]), Press Enter key.
11.	Repeat steps 8,9 and 10 for 2nd sequence.
12.	Enter distance metric,  0 for Euclidean, 1 for taxicab, 2 for Minkowski (press Enter)
13.	Record distance returned.
14.	For 2nd pair of sequences repeat steps from 7 to 13. 
Record the distance computed between the pair of sequences

For Finding the best match for a given query sequence USING GDTW DISTANCES
15.	Press 2 at step 7.
16.	Enter 1 to load query from dataset
	16.1    Enter Time series id, press Enter
	16.2    Enter start of query sequence
	16.3    Enter end of query sequence
	16.4    Enter distance metric
17.	Enter 2 to load query from file. Press Enter.
	17.1	Enter path of query file. Press Enter
	17.2	Enter length of query sequence. Press Enter
	17.3.	Enter distance metric
18.	Record the distance, sequence returned as best match, warp count in case of DTW distances
