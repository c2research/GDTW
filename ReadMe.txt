GDTW: Generalized Dynamic Time Warping System
================================================

GDTW is a system that supports warping different distance measures for similarity. We generalize the classic DTW distance and extend its warping ability to distances syuited for different application domains. With this system user can find the generalized and point to point distances between two given sequences of a dataset along with finding the most similar sequence for a given query sequence using any distance metric.


Building
--------
GDTW can be built on Windows or POSIX systems using gcc (mingw) and Make.
To build GDTW, run either

`make GDTWCode`
or
`make`

To clean the codebase, run
`make clean`


Usage
-----
Detailed instruction can be found in Instructions.txt document.
